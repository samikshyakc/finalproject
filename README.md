Final Project of Data Science Technology and Systems Assignment
# On-Premises Flight Delay Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for predicting flight delays using machine learning models, specifically designed to be executed in an on-premises environment. The project uses a historical dataset of U.S. domestic flights to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on various features, including weather conditions, airline, origin, and destination.

## Prerequisites

To set up this project on your local machine, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for optional use with `.ipynb` files in the notebooks directory)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd onpremises

## Expected Output
- **Training:** After running the training code, you will see the training metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) displayed in the terminal.
-**Evaluation:** : The evaluate code will display the model's performance on the validation/test dataset, including a classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
